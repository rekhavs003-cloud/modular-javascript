/**** DESIGNING UNIT TESTS: SOLUTION ****/

/*
    As your test suites expand, writing disorganized, chaotic test blocks 
    leads to fragile testing code. To write professional tests, we rely on 
    structured organization patterns:

    The AAA Principle (Arrange, Act, Assert): The golden rule of test design. 
    You cleanly divide every test block into three visual steps:
        - Arrange: Set up the test environment, mock data, and instances.
        - Act: Execute the target function or behavior you are actively auditing.
        - Assert: Run Jest matchers to prove the output matches your hypothesis.

    beforeEach(): If you are testing a Class instance (like a Warrior), running 
    multiple tests against the same object will bleed state data across tests 
    (e.g., Test 1 reduces the warrior's health, causing Test 2 to run with 
    damaged data). beforeEach runs cleanly before every single individual test, 
    manufacturing a pristine, identical setup every time and ensuring stable
    tests.
*/


import Warrior from "../models/Warrior.js";

describe("Warrior Class Operational Metrics", () => {
    let testHero;

    // HOOK SETUP: Automatically instantiates a fresh player before every test
    beforeEach(() => {
        testHero = new Warrior("Arthur");
    });

    test("accurately calculates health reductions following multi-hit damage spikes", () => {
        // 1. ARRANGE (State setup)
        const minorHit = 15;
        const criticalHit = 40;

        // 2. ACT (Execute behavior sequence)
        testHero.takeDamage(minorHit);
        testHero.takeDamage(criticalHit);

        // 3. ASSERT (Verify metrics)
        expect(testHero.health).toBe(45);
    });

    test("successfully alters active tactical combat modes", () => {
        // 1. ARRANGE
        // Handled completely by the clean beforeEach hook

        // 2. ACT
        testHero.switchStance();

        // 3. ASSERT
        expect(testHero.stance).toBe("Aggressive");
    });
});
